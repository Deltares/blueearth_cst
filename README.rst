BlueEarth Climate Stress Test toolbox
#####################################

The BlueEarth Climate Stress Tester (blueearth_cst) is a free, open-source, and online toolbox for interactive climate risk assessment based on bottom-up analysis principles. 
The toolbox will enable end-users to: 

 - Explore the range of hydroclimatic uncertainty in a selected geographic area of choice, including natural variability and climate change signals.  

 - Design and execute a climate stress test for the response and vulnerabilities of user-defined thresholds and metrics.  

 - Make a judgment on the plausibility of vulnerabilities identified using climate model projections. As such, users should be able to estimate up to what extent the chosen metric or parameter may be sensitive to climate change. 

 - Provide a user-friendly tool with visualization elements that satisfy the needs and expectations of non-specialized audiences 

The Climate Stress Tester is part of the _BlueEarth initiative and uses hydromt_weather as weather generator and _Wflow for hydrological modelling.
